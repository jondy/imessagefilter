 IMessageFilter
=================

A python package implements interface IMessageFilter for COM.

The main purpose is to fix 'Application is Busy' and 'Call was Rejected By Callee' errors in a WINDOWS COM/COM+ client.

Here is a workaround

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms228772(v=vs.140)

But it's written by C#, this package offers both C and Python versions.

Usage
-----

Install it::

  pip install imessagefilter

Import `CMessageFilter` from `imessagefilter`

Call static method `register` at the beginning of automation

Call static method `revoke` at the end of work

Here it's an example:

.. code:: python

    from comtypes.client import CreateObject
    from imessagefilter import CMessageFilter

    def iter_excel_sheets(filename):
        CMessageFilter.register()
        aobj = CreateObject('Excel.Application', dynamic=True)
        aobj.Workbooks.Open(filename)
        for sheet in aobj.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets:
            print('Processing %s' % sheet.Name)
        CMessageFilter.revoke()


.. note::

   The interface `IMessageFilter` only works in single-threaded
   apartments, it will not be called in the multithreaded
   apartments.

Build `msgfilter.dll`
---------------------

By visual studio command line::

    cl /LD msgfilter.c ole32.lib

By mingw32 in cygwin::

    i686-pc-mingw32-gcc -shared -o msgfilter.dll msgfilter.c -lole32 -luuid

There are 2 export functions, they can be used in any c file.

Here it's an exmaple:

.. code:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <objbase.h>

    extern void register_message_filter();
    extern void revoke_message_filter();

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      HRESULT ret;
      ret = CoInitializeEx(0, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED);
      register_message_filter();

      // do something for automation

      revoke_message_filter();
      CoUninitialize();

      return 0;
    }
